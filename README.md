# Kana Site

A simple, self-contained web app for practicing Japanese typing and conversions.  
It takes romaji input and converts it to hiragana, katakana, or kanji suggestions — just like an IME, but in your browser.

## Features

- **Romaji → Kana conversion**  
  Type naturally (e.g. `nihongo`) and it instantly converts to `にほんご` or `ニホンゴ`.

- **Kanji suggestions**  
  Shows matching words like `日本語` for `にほんご`.  
  You can toggle or accept suggestions just like a normal IME.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
  Hear your text spoken with a Japanese voice — great for quick pronunciation checks.

- **Keyboard-focused**  
  Built to stay on the keyboard.  
  Shortcuts like copy, clear, and toggle modes mean you never need the mouse.

- **Offline-ready (PWA)**  
  Works fully offline once loaded.  
  You can even install it to your desktop or phone for quick access.

- **Simple, single-page design**  
  No dependencies, no frameworks, no nonsense — just a single HTML file that does everything.
